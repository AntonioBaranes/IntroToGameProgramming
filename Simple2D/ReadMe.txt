This is my creating 2D scenes assignment for my intro to game programming class


Spoilers for Chrono Trigger!!!


It's a recreation of the scene where Crono dies but I added a few things just for the purposes of
the project

Lavos Pods

The lavos pods normally appear in the final boss fight not this one but I needed objects to move in
relation to one another so I decided to bring them over. I also used them to have an object transate
in a way other than verticle or horizontal... they move verticle and horizontal at the same time
I hope this counts for the extra credit of having two objects move in a non verticle or horizontal 
pattern! 

Lavos

Lavos is the main boss in the scene. He is being scaled up and down to have him pulse menacingly!
I hope this counts as the extra credit for altering the scale

Crono

Finally, we have Crono who dies in the scene. I have him rotating to symbolize this... I actually
just needed an object to rotate for credit and this reason was what my brain decided to come up 
with.

Thanks for reading!!!
