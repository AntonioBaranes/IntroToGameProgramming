Movement programming in video games

coordinates held in matrix and vectors

scalar multiplication: multiplication with no direction

Matrix multiplication: must be compatible -> (m * n) * (n * k) is compatible because of both ns
                                             will result in an m * k matrix

                                             OpenGl calcs for you

Rotation: rotation matrix is wack google it lol
